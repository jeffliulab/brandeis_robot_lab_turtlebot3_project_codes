• Used LiDAR sensors for detecting obstacles and walls, filtered noise to improve the accuracy and publish the utilized messages, implementing wall-following function with PID control to keep a consistent distance from walls.
• Captured and using OpenCV to process images using a USB camera and publishing processed data for further tasks. Implemented line-following function by detecting the centroid of the line and using P control to follow.
• Recognized visual fiducials to identify specific markers and control the robot to accurately approach and stop in front of them.
